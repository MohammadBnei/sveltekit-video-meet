With this structure, you can easily navigate through the tutorial and reference specific sections as needed. Now, let's dive right into building your WebRTC application.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Socket.io Server (`server.ts`)

### 1.1. Create the Signal Server File

Within your project directory, create a new file named `server.ts`. It will contain the server-side logic needed to handle WebRTC signaling between clients.

### 1.2. Write the Server Logic

Open the `server.ts` file and input the following TypeScript code:

```typescript
// server.ts
import { Server, Socket } from "socket.io";

export default function (server) {
  const io = new Server(server.httpServer);

  io.on("connection", (socket: Socket) => {
    socket.on("join-room", async (roomID: string) => {
      socket.join(roomID);
      const users = await io.in(roomID).fetchSockets();
      socket.to(roomID).emit("user-joined", socket.id);
      socket.emit("users", users.map((socket) => socket.id));
    });

    socket.on("offer", (payload: { target: string; caller: string; sdp: RTCSessionDescriptionInit; }) => {
      io.to(payload.target).emit("offer", payload);
    });

    socket.on("answer", (payload: { target: string; caller: string; sdp: RTCSessionDescriptionInit; }) => {
      io.to(payload.target).emit("answer", payload);
    });

    socket.on("ice-candidate", (incoming: { target: string; candidate: RTCIceCandidateInit; }) => {
      io.to(incoming.target).emit("ice-candidate", incoming.candidate);
    });

    socket.on("end-call", (data: { to: string; }) => {
      io.to(data.to).emit("end-call", data);
    });

    socket.on("disconnecting", () => {
      socket.rooms.forEach((room) => {
        if (room !== socket.id) {
          socket.to(room).emit("user-left", socket.id);
        }
      });
    });
  });
}
```

**Explanation:**
This server file is responsible for managing the signaling needed for WebRTC communication. It uses Socket.io to create a WebSocket server wrapped around your existing HTTP server. It then listens for various events such as `join-room`, `offer`, `answer`, `ice-candidate`, `end-call`, and socket disconnects. These events handle the necessary signaling exchange for establishing peer connections and maintaining the state of the call within the room.

<details>
<summary >More infos</summary>

#### Event: `join-room`

When a client wants to establish a WebRTC connection, they first need to join a "room"â€”a conceptual place on the server where clients can group together. In this application, joining a room is the first step in initiating peer connections.

**What it's doing:**

- The client emits a `join-room` event with a `roomID` to the server.
- The server adds the client to the specified room.
- The server retrieves the current list of client sockets connected to that room.
  
**Information passed:**

- `roomID`: A unique identifier for the room that the client wishes to join.

**Purpose:**

- To isolate signaling traffic to only those clients that need to communicate with each other.
- To provide each client with the list of peers in the room to facilitate subsequent signaling operations.

#### Event: `offer`

An `offer` is a session description protocol (SDP) message that one client sends to initiate a connection. It contains all the necessary information for setting up the media transmission, including codecs and other options.

**What it's doing:**

- The `offer` event relays an SDP message (the offer) from one client (the caller) to another (the callee).
  
**Information passed:**

- `target`: The socket ID of the client that should receive the offer.
- `caller`: The socket ID of the client making the offer.
- `sdp`: The SDP data of the offer.

**Purpose:**

- To initiate the WebRTC connection establishment process.
- To convey the media configuration that the caller wants to use.

#### Event: `answer`

The `answer` is also an SDP message but is sent in response to an offer. It signifies acceptance of the connection and can include session details specific to the answerer.

**What it's doing:**

- The `answer` event relays an SDP message (the answer) back to the original offerer.

**Information passed:**

- Same structure as `offer`, where `target` this time is the original offerer's socket ID, and `sdp` is the answer SDP data.

**Purpose:**

- To complete the negotiation of the WebRTC connection establishment process after an offer is made.

#### Event: `ice-candidate`

During the WebRTC connection establishment process, clients need to discover and negotiate the network paths between them. This is where ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) candidates come into play.

**What it's doing:**

- The event is emitted by a client when it has discovered a new ICE candidate, which is then relayed to the other peer.

**Information passed:**

- `target`: The socket ID of the other client that the ICE candidate is being sent to.
- `candidate`: The actual ICE candidate object containing network information.

**Purpose:**

- For the peers to exchange information about their network endpoints (IP addresses, ports, protocols).
- To discover the best paths for establishing the peer-to-peer media stream.

#### Event: `end-call`

When a client wishes to end the call or close the connection, an end-call message is sent to clean up any server-side or client-side state related to the call.

**What it's doing:**

- It relays a message to the other peer that the call has ended.

**Information passed:**

- `to`: The socket ID of the peer that needs to be informed that the call is ending.

**Purpose:**

- To allow peers to gracefully end the call and perform necessary clean-up like releasing resources.

#### Event: `disconnecting`

This event is triggered by Socket.io itself when a client is about to disconnect, regardless of the reason (could be network issues, user leaves, etc.).

**What it's doing:**

- It loops through all the rooms a disconnecting client is in (except their own default room, which has the same name as their socket ID) and notifies all other clients in those rooms.

**Information passed:**

- `reason`: The reason for the disconnection, if available.

**Purpose:**

- To inform the rest of the users in the room when a user disconnects so that clients can update their UI and state accordingly.

These signaling events are the backbone of the negotiation necessary to establish a WebRTC connection. By passing this information between clients, it allows for the setup of the media stream transmission over a peer-to-peer network connection

**With this setup, the initial server configuration to facilitate signaling for WebRTC connections is complete.**

## Step 2: Implementing the Client Logic (`+page.svelte`)

### 2.1. Create the Svelte Page File

Within your project, navigate to the routes directory and create a new file named `[roomId]/+page.svelte`. This file will handle the client-side WebRTC logic and user interface.

### 2.2. Scaffold the Svelte Page

Start with the script tag and import necessary functions from Svelte's lifecycle and store, as well as Socket.io client and WebRTC objects. Also declare reactive and local variables that will manage the connection state and user media.

Include the following code in your `+page.svelte` file:

```typescript
<script lang="ts">
  import { onMount, onDestroy } from 'svelte';
  import { io, Socket } from 'socket.io-client';
  import Video from '$lib/components/video.svelte';
  import IncommingCall from '$lib/components/incoming-call.svelte';
  import RemoteUsersModal from '$lib/components/remote-users-modal.svelte';
  import RoomInfo from '$lib/components/room-info.svelte';
  import { goto } from '$app/navigation';

  export let data: { roomId: string };

  let users: string[] = [];
  let socket: Socket;
  let currentUser: string;
  let isIncommingCall = false;
  let incomingPayload: any = null;
  let isCallAccepted = false;
  let peer: RTCPeerConnection;

  let userStream: MediaStream;
  let remoteStream: MediaStream;

  let isUserCameraOn = true;
  let isUserMicOn = true;
  
  $: connectedUsers = users.filter((user) => user !== currentUser);

  onMount(async () => {
    
  });

  onDestroy(() => {
    
  });

  // More functions and logic will be added here in the next steps...
</script>
```

**Explanation:**
The script tag here begins the setup for our client-side logic. It will manage the lifecycle of our Svelte component and make use of WebRTC APIs, as well as handle our real-time socket connection. This code stub also includes initialization for state variables and sets up the reactivity needed for Svelte's rendering.

### 2.3. Begin WebRTC and Socket.io Initialization

Within the `onMount` function, start initializing your WebSocket connection, set up the event listeners, and request user media.

Fill in the `onMount` and `onDestroy` functions as follows:

```typescript
<script>
  // ... existing code

  onMount(async () => {
    socket = io();

    socket.on("connect", () => {
      currentUser = socket.id;
      socket.emit("join-room", data.roomId);
    });

    socket.on("users", (data) => {
      users = data;
    });

    socket.on("user-joined", (userID) => {
      users = [...users, userID];
    });

    socket.on("user-left", (userID) => {
      users = users.filter((user) => user !== userID);
    });

    socket.on("offer", (data) => {
      isIncommingCall = true;
      incomingPayload = data;
    });

    // Placeholder for handling answer and ice-candidate events

    onDestroy(() => {
      // Placeholder for cleanup logic, stopping media tracks etc.
      if (socket) socket.disconnect();
    });
  });

  // More functions and logic to be filled in subsequent steps...
</script>
```

**Explanation:**
In the `onMount` lifecycle function, we're establishing a connection to our Socket.io server and setting up various event listeners to handle the join, offer, and user management. Within `onDestroy`, we will clean up by disconnecting from the socket when the Svelte component is destroyed.

## Step 3: WebRTC Signaling Logic in `+page.svelte`

### 3.1. Implementing WebRTC Methods

Now, let's implement the functions required for handling the signaling process, starting a call, and managing the peer connection.

Below your existing `onMount` and `onDestroy` functions in the `+page.svelte` file, add the following:

```typescript
<script>
  // ... existing code from previous steps

  function createPeerConnection() {
    peer = new RTCPeerConnection({
      iceServers: [
        {
          urls: 'stun:stun.stunprotocol.org',
        }
        // ... In a real-world application, TURN servers should also be listed here
      ],
    });

    peer.ontrack = handleTrackEvent;
    peer.onicecandidate = handleICECandidateEvent;
    peer.onnegotiationneeded = () => handleNegotiationNeededEvent(data.roomId);

    userStream.getTracks().forEach((track) => peer.addTrack(track, userStream));
  }

  function handleOffer({ caller, sdp }) {
    isIncommingCall = true;
    incomingPayload = { caller, sdp };
  }

  function handleAnswer(message) {
    const desc = new RTCSessionDescription(message.sdp);
    peer.setRemoteDescription(desc).catch((error) => {
      console.error("Error setting remote description", error);
    });
  }

  function handleICECandidateEvent(event) {
    if (event.candidate) {
      socket.emit('ice-candidate', {
        target: incomingPayload.caller,
        candidate: event.candidate,
      });
    }
  }

  function handleNewICECandidateMsg(incoming) {
    const candidate = new RTCIceCandidate(incoming.candidate);
    peer.addIceCandidate(candidate).catch((error) => {
      console.error("Error adding received ICE candidate", error);
    });
  }

  function handleTrackEvent(event) {
    remoteStream = event.streams[0];
  }

  function handleNegotiationNeededEvent(roomId) {
    peer.createOffer().then((offer) => {
      return peer.setLocalDescription(offer);
    }).then(() => {
      socket.emit('offer', {
        target: roomId,
        caller: currentUser,
        sdp: peer.localDescription,
      });
    }).catch((error) => {
      console.error("Error creating offer", error);
    });
  }

  // ... Additional logic and functions will be added in subsequent steps...
</script>
```

**Explanation:**
The added functions are essential parts of the WebRTC signaling process:

- `createPeerConnection` sets up the peer connection with the necessary event handlers and adds the user's media tracks to it.
- `handleOffer` manages incoming offers by setting the flag indicating an incoming call and storing the payload to be used later.
- `handleAnswer` sets the remote description of the peer connection once an answer is received.
- `handleICECandidateEvent` emits a signal to the server when a new ICE candidate is found locally.
- `handleNewICECandidateMsg` adds received ICE candidates to the peer connection.
- `handleTrackEvent` manages what happens when remote media tracks are received.
- `handleNegotiationNeededEvent` creates and sends an offer when negotiation is needed.

## Step 4: Managing Calls and User Media in `+page.svelte`

### 4.1. Implementing Call Answering Logic

We need to define logic that handles an incoming call. When a user decides to answer an incoming call, the `createPeerConnection` function should be invoked, and the media session description should be processed.

Add the following code block to implement the handling for accepting a call:

```typescript
<script>
  // ... existing code from previous steps
  
  function handleReceiveCall() {
    isIncommingCall = false;
    createPeerConnection();
    const desc = new RTCSessionDescription(incomingPayload.sdp);
    peer.setRemoteDescription(desc).then(() => {
      return peer.createAnswer();
    }).then((answer) => {
      return peer.setLocalDescription(answer);
    }).then(() => {
      socket.emit('answer', {
        target: incomingPayload.caller,
        caller: socket.id,
        sdp: peer.localDescription,
      });
      isCallAccepted = true;
    }).catch((error) => {
      console.error("Error handling receive call", error);
    });
  }

  // ... Additional logic to be added in the next steps
</script>
```

**Explanation:**
When the function `handleReceiveCall` is called after the user decides to answer the incoming call, the following steps occur:

- The incoming call state is updated.
- A peer connection is established.
- The incoming session description protocol (SDP) is set as the remote description.
- An answer is created and set as the local description.
- The answer is sent back to the caller with an 'answer' event via the socket.

### 4.2. Implementing Call Rejection Logic

Sometimes a user may want to reject an incoming call. We should provide a way to reset the call state when a call is rejected. Add the following function:

```typescript
<script>
  // ... existing code from previous steps

  function handleRejectCall() {
    isIncommingCall = false;
    incomingPayload = null;
  }

  // ... Additional logic to be added in the next steps
</script>
```

**Explanation:**
`handleRejectCall` simply updates the state to reflect that there is no longer an incoming call to be processed.

### 4.3. Outgoing Call Function

Add a function to initiate a call to a peer when the user wishes to contact someone directly:

```typescript
<script>
  // ... existing code from previous steps

  function callUser(userID: string) {
    remoteUser = userID;
    createPeerConnection();
  }

  // ... Additional logic to be added in the next steps
</script>
```

**Explanation:**
`callUser` is the function triggered when the local user wants to start a call with a specific user. It updates the `remoteUser` with the ID of the user being called and kicks off the process of creating a peer connection.

### 4.4. Implementing UI Bindings and Event Listeners

Now you can bind these functions to the user interface, enabling interactive call management. Detailed implementation will be based on your Svelte components for incoming calls, video display, and media controls.

### 4.5. User Media Stream Initialization

We also need to acquire the user's media streams when they load the page. Include the following logic in the `onMount` lifecycle function:

```typescript
<script>
  // ... existing code from previous steps

  onMount(async () => {
    // ... existing socket setup logic

    try {
      userStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
        video: true,
        audio: true
      });
      // The userStream is assigned the media stream from the getUserMedia promise
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error accessing media devices.", error);
    }
  });

  // ... Additional logic to be added in the next steps
</script>
```

**Explanation:**
The above `onMount` function extension attempts to acquire media streams from the user's camera and microphone using the `getUserMedia` API. This stream is then fed into the peer connection process to be sent to the remote peer.

**At this point, ensure that your `+page.svelte` file has the call management logic, user media stream handling, and related functions.**

## Step 5: Finalizing Call and Stream Cleanup Logic in `+page.svelte`

The last part of setting up the client logic includes managing the end of calls and cleaning up media streams properly. We will also implement UI controls to allow the user to end a call and toggle their audio/video tracks.

### 5.1. Ending the Call

Add functions to end a call, handle a hung-up call from the remote user, and clean up media streams and peer connections.

Continue expanding the `+page.svelte` file:

```typescript
<script>
  // ... existing code from previous steps

  function handleHangUp() {
    socket.emit("end-call", {
      to: remoteUser,
    });
    resetCallState();
  }

  function handleRemoteHangUp() {
    resetCallState();
  }

  function resetCallState() {
    if (peer) {
      peer.close();
      peer = null;
    }
    if (userStream) {
      userStream.getTracks().forEach((track) => track.stop());
      userStream = null;
    }
    remoteStream = null;
    isCallAccepted = false;
    remoteUser = "";
    goto("/");
  }

  // ... Additional logic to be added in the next steps
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- `handleHangUp` is called when the local user decides to end the call. It emits an "end-call" event to the server to inform the remote user and resets the local call state.
- `handleRemoteHangUp` is called in response to the remote user ending the call. It also calls `resetCallState` to clean up.
- `resetCallState` contains logic to close the peer connection and stop all media streams, both local and remote, and then resets the state variables.

### 5.2. Toggle Camera and Microphone

Implement the functions to toggle the user's camera and microphone on or off during a call.

```typescript
<script>
  // ... existing code from previous steps
  
  function toggleCamera() {
    const videoTrack = userStream.getVideoTracks()[0];
    if (videoTrack) {
      isUserCameraOn = !videoTrack.enabled;
      videoTrack.enabled = !videoTrack.enabled;
    }
  }

  function toggleMic() {
    const audioTrack = userStream.getAudioTracks()[0];
    if (audioTrack) {
      isUserMicOn = !audioTrack.enabled;
      audioTrack.enabled = !audioTrack.enabled;
    }
  }

  // ... rest of your script
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- `toggleCamera` accesses the first video track of the `userStream` and toggles the `enabled` status, effectively turning the camera on or off.
- `toggleMic` does the same for the audio tracks, controlling whether the user's microphone is active.

### 5.3. Completing the `onDestroy` Cleanup

Ensure that `onDestroy` contains all necessary cleanup logic, including disconnecting the socket and stopping media tracks:

```typescript
<script>
  // ... existing code from previous steps

  onDestroy(() => {
    socket.disconnect();
    if (userStream) {
      userStream.getTracks().forEach((track) => track.stop());
    }
    if (peer) {
      peer.close();
    }
  });

  // ... rest of your script
</script>
```

**Explanation:**
`onDestroy` is triggered when the Svelte component gets unmounted. This hook is responsible for cleaning up by disconnecting from the WebSocket server and stopping any active media streams to release hardware resources.

**With these additions, your `+page.svelte` file now has a complete set of functions for setting up WebRTC calls, managing the user's media, responding to signaling messages, handling incoming and outgoing calls, and cleaning up media resources when the component is destroyed or the user navigates away.**

## Step 6: UI Integration and Testing

With the JavaScript functionality in place, your next step will be to integrate these functions with your user interface components in Svelte. This step will allow users to interact with your application: answering/declining calls, hanging up calls, and toggling camera and microphone.

### 6.1. Connect Functions to UI Elements

In the `+page.svelte` file, beneath the `<script>` section where you have declared your functions and state logic, you will now markup your HTML to bind your UI components with the corresponding Svelte functions.

```svelte
<svelte:head
  ><title>
    Room | {data.roomId}
  </title></svelte:head
>

<RoomInfo />
<div class="pb-4 flex justify-end gap-2">
  <RemoteUsersModal
    on:calluser={(ev) => callUser(ev.detail.user)}
    users={connectedUsers}
    room={data.roomId}
  />
</div>

<!-- incomming call  -->

{#if isIncommingCall}
  <IncommingCall
    caller={incommingPayload.caller}
    on:receivecall={handleRecieveCall}
    on:rejectcall={handleRejectCall}
  />
{/if}

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <Video isCurrentUser={true} user={currentUser} stream={userStream} />
  <Video user={remoteUser} stream={remoteStream} />
</div>

{#if isCallAccepted}
  <div
    class="flex items-center justify-center space-x-2 absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 p-4"
  >
    <button
      class="btn btn-error btn-circle"
      on:click={handleHangUp}
      title="Hangup"
    >
      <iconify-icon width={24} height={24} icon="fluent:call-28-regular" />
    </button>

    <button
      class={"btn btn-circle"}
      title="Toggle camera"
      class:btn-error={!isUserCameraOn}
      on:click={toggleCamera}
    >
      {#if isUserCameraOn}
        <iconify-icon width={24} height={24} icon="carbon:video" />
      {:else}
        <iconify-icon width={24} height={24} icon="carbon:video-off" />
      {/if}
    </button>
    <button
      class="btn btn-circle"
      class:btn-error={!isUserMicOn}
      title="Toggle mic"
      on:click={toggleMic}
    >
      {#if isUserMicOn}
        <iconify-icon width={24} height={24} icon="fluent:mic-32-regular" />
      {:else}
        <iconify-icon width={24} height={24} icon="fluent:mic-off-32-regular" />
      {/if}
    </button>
  </div>
{/if}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `{#if ...}` block conditionally renders elements depending on whether an incoming call is detected or if a call has been accepted.
- Event listeners such as `on:click` bind our Svelte functions to UI events like button clicks, ensuring UI controls function correctly.

### 6.2. Testing the Application

After integrating the UI components with the functions, the next vital step is testing the entire application to validate the correct functioning of call setup, media stream handling, user interactions, and cleanup processes.

1. Run your development server to build and serve your application.
2. Connect to your application from multiple browser tabs or different devices to start testing.
3. Attempt to initiate, receive, and hang up calls between the connected clients.
4. Test toggling the camera and microphone to ensure they behave as expected.
5. Monitor the browser's console for any errors or unexpected behavior.
6. Pay special attention to the cleanup process to confirm that streams stop correctly when navigating away or closing the viewer tab.

**Note:** Make sure you also handle any errors that may arise due to users not granting permission for media access or other potential issues. This handling was not provided but is essential for a robust application.

**With the functionalities tied to your UI, you should now have a working prototype that allows for real-time video and audio communication. You've achieved this by implementing WebRTC to establish peer-to-peer connections and using Socket.io for real-time signaling between clients.**

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've just completed crafting a fully functional WebRTC application powered by Svelte on the client side and a Node.js server leveraging Socket.io for real-time communication. The implementation you've walked through is a testament to the powerful capabilities of modern web technologies to facilitate live, peer-to-peer audio and video communication.

To summarize, here's what you've accomplished:

1. **Server Setup:** You configured a Socket.io server to handle WebRTC signaling and manage user connections.

2. **Client Preparation:** You set up the initial client-side logic, handling user media and establishing the WebSocket connection.

3. **WebRTC Signaling:** You defined client-side functions to manage WebRTC signaling, such as creating offers/answers and handling ICE candidates.

4. **Call Management:** You implemented functions to answer, reject, and hang up calls, including the UI interactions that users engage with during a call.

5. **Media Stream Management:** You wired up user interactions to toggle camera and microphone, ensuring that users have control over their media devices.

6. **Cleanup and Testing:** Finally, you ensured that the application properly cleans up media resources and peer connections on component destruction or when users navigate away.

Testing and refining your application is an ongoing process, and you may want to consider the following for further development:

- **User Experience:** Polishing the UI/UX to make the application more intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing comprehensive error handling to manage edge cases, such as lack of browser support, media device errors, and network issues.
- **Security:** Ensuring secure communication channels between clients, possibly using HTTPS and secure WebSocket (WSS).
- **Scalability and Performance:** Optimizing server architecture and media handling for better scalability and performance under load.
- **Extended Features:** Adding features such as text chat, file sharing, or screen sharing to enrich the application's capabilities.

Remember, this tutorial provided a foundational implementation of WebRTC communication. What you build on top of this foundation can be as simple or complex as your project requires.

As you continue developing, testing, and extending your application's features, you'll deepen your understanding of real-time communication protocols and front-end development with Svelte. Don't hesitate to dive into the WebRTC and Socket.io documentation to explore additional options and configurations.
